# 2D Biking Simulation Game

## Project Overview
This project is a 2D biking simulation game focused on helping beginners learn the rules of biking and improve their skills in a fun, interactive environment. The game provides real-time feedback to players and tracks their progress, helping them improve over time. The goal is to create an educational tool that promotes healthy and safe biking practices.

## Features
- Interactive Tutorials: Real-time biking rule tutorials.
- AI-Driven Feedback: Players get immediate feedback when they make mistakes (e.g., running a red light, not signaling a turn).
- Progress Tracking: Tracks the player's performance and suggests areas for improvement.
- 2D Graphics: Simple 2D world with customizable biking levels.

## Libraries Used
- Arcade: Used for creating the 2D game engine, managing graphics, inputs, and game logic.
- Pillow: Used for handling and manipulating game assets like images and sprites.
- Pygame: An alternative library for handling 2D game creation and managing game loops.
